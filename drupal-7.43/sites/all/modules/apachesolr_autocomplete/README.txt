Apache Solr Autocomplete module for Drupal.

-- SUMMARY --

Add-on module to Apache Solr Search Integration that adds simple autocomplete
functionality. It enforces node access, meaning that all suggestions are only
from nodes that the user actually has access to.

For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
  http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr_autocomplete

-- REQUIREMENTS --

Apache Solr Search Integration module.
See http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr


-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual.
  Read http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
  to learn how to install contributed Drupal modules.


-- CONFIGURATION  --

In your Drupal website, browse to the settings page of the Apache Solr module
at /admin/config/search/apachesolr/settings:

  Configuration >> Search and metadata >> Apache Solr search
  Tab: Settings 

In the section "Advanced configuration" choose which autocomplete widget to use.

You can choose between:

* a custom JavaScript widget
* the jQuery UI Autocomplete widget provided by Drupal core.
* the Drupal autocomplete widget used elsewhere (like for taxonomy autocomplete).

The default is to use the jQuery UI widget.

Normally, the module will make autocomplete responses cacheable by external
caches (e.g., Varnish) using the page_cache_maximum_age Drupal variable (set in
Admin > Config > Performance > Expiration of Cached Pages). Optionally, you can
set a different cache lifetime just for autocomplete responses by overriding
this variable in settings.php:

  // Make autocomplete responses cacheable for 3600 seconds (1 hour)
  $conf['apachesolr_autocomplete_cache_maximum_age'] = 3600;

If you set this to 0, responses will *not* have the necessary Cache-Control
headers and thus will not be cached externally.

-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

If you are having trouble with the autocomplete suggestions not working 
correctly, try changing the configuration to use the core Drupal autocomplete
widget.

If you encounter other problems, please post to the project issue queue:
